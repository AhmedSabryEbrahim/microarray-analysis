# Analysis of publically-available microarray datasets


## Description
It is now widely-accepted that Next-Generation Sequencing technologies have suceeded microarrays as being the method of choice for gene expression profiling. However, the years of experience gained from analysing microarrays has led to a variety of analysis techniques and datasets that can be exploited in other contexts. In this course, we will focus on retrieving and exploring microarray data from public repositories such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).


## Aims: During the course you will learn about

- Exploratory data analysis techniques for high-throughput data
- Normalisation of gene expression data
- Differential expression (DE) analysis using linear-modelling techniques
- Importing data from GEO into R
- Principal Components Analysis and hierachical clustering of gene expression data

## Objectives: After this course you should be able to

- Import gene expression datasets from GEO into R
- Assess the quality of a dataset in a repository
- Spot, and correct for, batch effects
- Peform a standard DE analysis to get a ranked list of genes
- Use un-supervised methods to explore a dataset
- Interrogate particular genes of interest

## Prerequisites
- A very basic knowledge of UNIX would be an advantage, but nothing will be assumed and extremely little will be required
- Attendees should be comfortable with using the R statistical language to read and manipulate data, and produce simple graphs
