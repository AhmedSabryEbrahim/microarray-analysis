# Introduction to gene expression analyses using high-throughput technologies


## Description
It is now widely-accepted that Next-Generation Sequencing technologies have suceeded microarrays as being the method of choice for gene expression profiling. However, the years of experience gained from analysing microarrays has led to a variety of analysis techniques and datasets that can be exploited in other contexts. In this course, we will focus on retrieving and exploring microarray data from public repositories such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

## Prerequisites
- A very basic knowledge of UNIX would be an advantage, but nothing will be assumed and extremely little will be required
- Attendees should be comfortable with using the R statistical language to read and manipulate data, and produce simple graphs

## Aims: During the course you will learn about

- Exploratory data analysis techniques for high-throughput data
- Differential expression (DE) analysis
- Importing data from GEO into R
- Principal Components Analysis and hierachical clustering of gene expression data

## Objectives: After this course you should be able to

- Download gene expression datasets from GEO 
- Peform DE analysis for a gene of interest
- Use un-supervised methods to explore a dataset
