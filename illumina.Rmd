# Illumina

## Single-channel microarrays  
+ 50 base-pair 'probes' with the same sequence are attached to a bead 
+ Beads that have the same probe sequence are known as a *bead-type*
+ Beads are identified by Illumina using a decoding sequence

## Randomly-arranged arrays

+ Arrays of randomly-arranged beads are constructed
+ The number of replicates of each bead-type follows a normal distribution
+ Around 20 replicates on most-recent arrays

![illumina-chips](images/chiptypes.png)

+ 'Refseq' chips with 24,000 bead-types per array, 8 arrays per chip
+  WG- chips with 48,000 bead-types per array, 6 arrays per chip
+ HT-12 chips with 48,000 bead-types per array, 12 arrays per chip
+ Each chip also has an annotation 'version' (v1, v2, v3, v4)


## Example Arrangement
Observations for Gene X on Illumina and older array technologies

Example
Consider a technical failure on one of the arrays

## Workflow
The analyst may have a choice over what data to take as a starting point

+ Raw images
+ Bead-level data - vary number of observations for a bead-type on each array and pre-computed intensities
+ Bead-summary - One value for each bead-type on each array. i.e. an 'Expression Matrix'
+ Starting with raw, or bead-level data gives more flexiblity in analysis
+ Bead-summary data fit in with standard Bioconductor tools

The [recommmended](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3228778/) approach is to work with the so-called ***bead-level*** data as it allows the entire analysis workflow to be performed in R and Bioconductor, with all the benefits of reproducibility and transparency that gives. However, in order to produce data of this type, several modifications need to be made to the manufacturer's scanning software. Consequently, data of this type are uncommon. 

If you have bead-level data, then for each hybridisation you will have;

1) A TIFF image representation of the array surface

2) A text description of the bead locations, unique to each array. This is required

## Workflow from bead-level data

```{r}
ht12metrics <- read.table(system.file("extdata/Chips/Metrics.txt" ,
  package = "BeadArrayUseCases") , sep = "\t" , header = TRUE ,as.is = TRUE )
ht12metrics
ht12snr <- ht12metrics$P95Grn / ht12metrics$P05Grn
plot (1:12 , ht12snr , pch = 19 , ylab = " P95 / P05 " , xlab = " " ,main = " Signal - to - noise ratio for HT12 data ")
axis (2)
axis (1 , 1:12 , labs , las = 2)
```



```{r cache=TRUE}
library(beadarray)

chipPath <- system.file("extdata/Chips",package="BeadArrayUseCases")
list.files(chipPath)
sampleSheetFile <- paste0(chipPath,"/sampleSheet.csv")
data <- readIllumina(dir=chipPath,sampleSheet=sampleSheetFile,illuminaAnnotation="Humanv3")
```



Just like with Affy data, we can visualise the raw images.

```{r cache=TRUE}
imageplot(data, array=6,high="darkgreen",low="lightgreen",zlim=c(4,10))
```


```{r cache=TRUE}
imageplot(data, array=8,high="darkgreen",low="lightgreen",zlim=c(4,10))
```



We could use [***BASH***](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/24/2921.full) which we don't cover today

```{r}
combinedControlPlot(data)
```


## Summarisation


Now we can summarise the data into a more-usable form



```{r cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
eset.ill <- summarize(data)
```

```{r}
eset.ill
```


The object should seem familiar from the previous section on Affymetrix

```{r}
head(exprs(eset.ill))
head(pData(eset.ill))
```

Examine the boxplot. Do the arrays seem normalised?

```{r}
boxplot(exprs(eset.ill),outline=FALSE)
```

We can normalise using `normaliseIllumina`

```{r}
eset.norm <- normaliseIllumina(eset.ill[,c(1:6,9:12)])
```

## Alternative data import

(from limma users guide)

```{r}
library(lumi)
```
